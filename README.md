### [Go to App](https://rxresu.me/)

### What is this app all about?

Reactive Resume is a free and open source resume builder that‚Äôs built to make the mundane tasks of creating, updating and sharing your resume as easy as 1, 2, 3. With this app, you can create multiple resumes, share them with recruiters through a unique link and print as PDF, all for free, no advertisements, without losing the integrity and privacy of your data.

You have complete control over what goes into your resume, how it looks, what colors, what templates, even the layout in which sections placed. Want a dark mode resume? It‚Äôs as easy as editing 3 values and you‚Äôre done. You don‚Äôt need to wait to see your changes either. Everything you type, everything you change, appears immediately on your resume and gets updated in real time.

### Features

### Translation

To translate the app, just fork the repository, go to `src/i18n/locales` and duplicate the `en.json` file to a new file `your-lang-code.json` and translate all of the strings inside. It's a simple process that would take just a few minutes, and by contributing, your name could also be added down below as a contributor.

For those of you familiar with the Crowdin Platform, you could do that too and just head to http://crowdin.com/project/reactive-resume/ to translate the app over there. They have a great interface that helps you navigate through various strings and manage translations.
