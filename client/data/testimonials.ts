    message: `Hi Amruth! First off, many thanks for making RxResume! It was love at first sight for me when I saw it was a FOSS resume-builder with such a polished UI. It's been of great help for me as I've been applying to MS programs in international universities. The generated resume is slick as hell, and I spent a fraction of the time building it that I would have spent, had I chosen the "Microsoft Word/Google Docs" route. And the best thing was I spent absolutely no money on it!`,
