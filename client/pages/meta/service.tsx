      <s>
        By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you - you should make sure therefore
        that you read them carefully before using the app. You&apos;re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part
        of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You&apos;re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the
        app, and you also shouldn&apos;t try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The
        app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related
        to it, still belong to Amruth Pillai.

    <p>
      Amruth Pillai is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
      reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We
      will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you&apos;re
      paying for.
    </p>

    <p>
      The CVPAP app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide my Service. It&apos;s
      your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not
      jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by
      the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious
      programs, compromise your phone&apos;s security features and it could mean that the CVPAP app won&apos;t work
      properly or at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should be aware that there are certain things that Amruth Pillai will not take responsibility for. Certain
      functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or
      provided by your mobile network provider, but Amruth Pillai cannot take responsibility for the app not working at
      full functionality if you don&apos;t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don&apos;t have any of your data allowance
      left.
    </p>

    <p></p>

    <p>
      If you&apos;re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement
      with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for
      the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In
      using the app, you&apos;re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you
      use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are
      not the bill payer for the device on which you&apos;re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
      received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
    </p>

    <p>
      Along the same lines, Amruth Pillai cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
      make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can&apos;t turn it on to avail the
      Service, Amruth Pillai cannot accept responsibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      With respect to Amruth Pillai&apos;s responsibility for your use of the app, when you&apos;re using the app,
      it&apos;s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all
      times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Amruth
      Pillai accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
      functionality of the app.
    </p>

    <p>
      At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for the
      system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and
      you&apos;ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Amruth Pillai does not promise that it
      will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have
      installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We
      may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of
      termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you
      in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
    </p>
