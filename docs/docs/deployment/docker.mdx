# Docker

You should be able to deploy a production-grade instance of this app within 5 minutes by just following this guide. For this example, I'll be creating a new DigitalOcean droplet to illustrate the steps.

1. Create a new droplet instance, preferably Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, with at least 2 GB of RAM. You can skip this step if you already have your own server. These are the settings I went with:

2. SSH into the instance, and update/upgrade dependencies. Then, install `docker` and `docker compose`. You can follow these links for steps on [how to install Docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04) and [how to install Docker Compose](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-20-04) on Ubuntu 20.04 (or any other OS).

Here are all the commands you need, for quick execution:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Docker
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
sudo apt install -y docker-ce

# Verify that Docker is installed
sudo systemctl status docker

# Install Docker Compose
mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins/
curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.2.3/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
sudo chown $USER /var/run/docker.sock

# Verify that Docker Compose is installed
docker-compose version
```

3. Create a new folder to host your app, then create a docker-compose.yml file. The contents of the file can be identical to the one found on the project root.

```bash
mkdir app && cd app
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmruthPillai/Reactive-Resume/main/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmruthPillai/Reactive-Resume/main/.env.example > .env
```

4. Edit the docker-compose.yml file you just pulled in and update the `<SERVER-IP>` placeholders to your server's public IP (or domain, if applicable). Also, update the `.env` file that was just created and change variables such as `PUBLIC_URL`, `PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` etc. For a clear understanding of what each of the environment variables mean, head over to [this section](/source-code/env-vars) of the docs.

To change the default port `80` to something else, say `3000`, just change the properties in docker-compose's traefik service:

```yml
traefik:
  command: ...
    - --entrypoints.web.address=:3000
  ports:
    - 3000:3000
```

5. Run the `up` command to check if everything is working as it should.

```
docker-compose up
```

/>

Now, your application should be running on http://SERVER-IP.
