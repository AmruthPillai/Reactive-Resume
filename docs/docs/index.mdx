## Summary

Reactive Resume is a free and open source resume builder that's built to make the mundane tasks of creating, updating and sharing your resume as easy as 1, 2, 3. With this app, you can create multiple resumes, share them with recruiters through a unique link and print as PDF, all for free, no advertisements, without losing the integrity and privacy of your data.

You have complete control over what goes into your resume, how it looks, what colors, what templates, even the layout in which sections placed. Want a dark mode resume? It's as easy as editing 3 values and you're done. You don't need to wait to see your changes either. Everything you type, everything you change, appears immediately on your resume and gets updated in real time.
