# 🦸 Setting up your account

Creating an account on Reactive Resume is straightforward and offers the advantage of being able to handle multiple resumes and access the same resume across different devices, such as a laptop, tablet, or mobile phone.

Firstly, head over to [https://rxresu.me](https://rxresu.me) and click on the "Get Started" button.

You can choose to sign in using your **GitHub** or **Google** account or register using your email address.
{% endhint %}

Clicking the sign-in button for GitHub or Google will lead to a swift sign-in process, and if the email linked to these services isn't previously registered, a new Reactive Resume account will be automatically created for you.

However, if you choose to register using your email address, you can click on the link that says "Create one now"

Here, all you need to do is enter a few bits of information like your name, email address, a unique username and a secure password. Once you're done with that, just click on the "Sign up" button.

At this stage, your account is already created. You will be then directed to a page that prompts you to verify your email address by checking for a verification link in your inbox.

{% hint style="info" %}
Email verification is not mandatory for accessing any features—it just confirms your email is valid for password recovery purposes.
{% endhint %}

After completing the registration, you can directly go to the [dashboard page](https://rxresu.me/dashboard/resumes) to manage your account or start crafting new resumes.
