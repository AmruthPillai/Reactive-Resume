# Gitpod

Simply click the badge below to open a new instance of [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/), where you can run the project by building from its source on a remote dev environment.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/AmruthPillai/Reactive-Resume)

Initially building the image and project on Gitpod will take at least 10-15 minutes, so please be patient on first launch. Any subsequent launches on the same workspace will be much faster.
